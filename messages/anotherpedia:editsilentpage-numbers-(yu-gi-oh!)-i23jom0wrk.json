They are the main focus of the {{iYu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL}} [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Each Number Monster has a corresponding [[natural number]] at the start of its name after \"Number\" or another letter like in the case of Chaos Numbers, Shining Numbers, etc. There are only two exceptions to that.<<note(content=Number XX: Utopic Dark Infinity and Number iC1000: Numerounius Numerounia (text=noteCountnote>> Numbers come in a few different varieties. There are the Emperor's Key Numbers, Barian Numbers, Over-Hundred Numbers, Chaos Numbers, Shining Numbers, Future Numbers, and Chaos Imaginary Numbers. In the anime, all Numbers share the effect that they cannot be destroyed in battle except by other Numbers, contrary to the card game. The effects of Numbers oftentimes differ between the anime, manga, and card game.<<hrEmperor's Key Numbershr>>Emperor's Key Numbers are the Numbers that came from the [[Emperor's Key|Emperor's Key (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. These Numbers are the fragments of [[Astral's|Astral (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] memories. The Emperor's Key Numbers have the 2nd highest amount of members to it at 100. These Numbers are the original Numbers. Of the original Numbers, 30 never appeared or were mentioned in the {{iZEXAL}} anime or manga. Those Numbers are 18, 24, 26, 27, 29, 36, 41, 45, 49, 51, 55, 57, 59, 60, 67, 68, 71, 74, 75, 76, 78, 79, 81, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 97, and 98.<<hrBarian Numbershr>>The Barian Numbers are the Numbers created by [[Don Thousand|Don Thousand (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. These Numbers have the most members at [[1,000,000|1000000]]. Of those 1,000,000 created Numbers, only 5 are known by name. Those known Barian Numbers are Infection Buzzking, Ninja Shadow Mosquito, Cicada King, Stealth Kragen, and Dark Illumiknight.<<hrOver-Hundred Numbershr>>The Over-Hundred Numbers are, as the name suggests, Numbers that have a natural number of over 100. These Numbers were the signature cards of the [[Seven Barian Emperors|Seven Barian Emperors (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]]. These Numbers were created by Don Thousand in order to suppress the Emperor's memories of their past lives when they were humans. It should be specified that there was only 1 Over-Hundred Number not created by Don Thousand, and that was Number 107: Galaxy-Eyes Tachyon Dragon which was instead created by the [[Numeron Dragon|Numeron Dragon (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]].<<hrChaos Numbershr>>Chaos Numbers are evolved versions of Numbers that are summoned by overlaying their base number and a special card, typically a [[Rank-Up-Magic|Rank-Up-Magic (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] card or another card that allows for the summoning of a Chaos Number such as [[Don Thousand's Throne|Don Thousand's Throne Card (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]].<<hr2Chaos Imaginary Numbershr2>>Chaos Imaginary Numbers are Chaos Numbers that have evolved even further beyond.<<hrShining Numbershr>>Shining Number Monsters are a type of evolved Number monster that only exists in the manga. This is considered the manga's counterpart of Chaos Numbers.<<hrFuture Numbershr>>Future Numbers are Numbers that were born from [[Yuma Tsukumo|Yuma Tsukumo (Yu-Gi-Oh!)]] and his belief in the future.<<hrList of all Numbershr>>;;[[Number XX: Utopic Dark Infinity]] |[[Number F0: Utopic Future]] |[[Number F0: Utopic Future Slash]] |[[Number F0: Utopic Draco Future]] |[[Number S0: Utopic ZEXAL]] |[[Number 1: Numeron Gate Ekam]] |[[Number C1: Numeron Gate Sunya]] |[[Number 1: Infection Buzzking]] |[[Number 2: Numeron Gate Dve]] |[[Number 2: Ninja Shadow Mosquito]] |[[Number 3: Numeron Gate Trini]] |[[Number 3: Cicada King]] |[[Number 4: Numeron Gate Catvari]] |[[Number 4: Stealth Kragen]] |[[Number 5: Doom Chimera Dragon]] |[[Number C5: Chaos Chimera Dragon]] |[[Number 6: Chronomaly Atlandis]] |[[Number C6: Chonomaly Chaos Atlandis]] |[[Number 7: Lucky Straight]] |[[Number 8: Heraldic King Genom -
