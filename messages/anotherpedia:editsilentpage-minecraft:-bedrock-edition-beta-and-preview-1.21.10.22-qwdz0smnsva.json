Both JSON and [[commands|command (Minecraft)]] can be used to influence this, with the following example:<<code/camera @s set minecraft:follow_orbit view_offset viewX viewYcode>>Starting radius and rotation for the {{codefollow_orbit}} and 3rd person boom camera presets have been added. The radius determines the camera distance from the player (fixed at 10 blocks) and the rotation determines pitch and yaw (fixed at 45X and 45Y).

The item must be in an armor slot to absorb damage, with durability damaged on absorption. Extra damage is dealt to the entity and ignored by the item's durability. When there are multiple items with {{codeminecraft:damage_absorption}}, one is selected at random. {{codeminecraft:durability_sensor}} can be added to items to create sounds and particles at different durability levels as defined through {{codedurability_thresholds}}. If multiple thresholds are met, only the lowest is run.<<hr2Experimental technical updateshr2>>{{codeplayerEmote}} has been added, which fires when a player uses an emote.&pWith the {{codeonTick}} event, blocks require {{codeminecraft:tick}} to determine their behaviors on ticks.
