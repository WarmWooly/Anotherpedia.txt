Conner101ful did so and sent that friend the recording. It was later uploaded to that friend's YouTube channel, which Conner101ful being credited for the voice-over. That video can be found here.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt9Bz6flctA (text=refCountref>> This friend would later request more voice recording from Conner101ful. His next appearance would be as [[Badsmoke the Monster| Badsmoke (Rufusboy69)]]. The video for this would later become private.The next piece of voice acting Conner101ful did was when that friend requested he make a voice recording of [[Shadow The Hedgehog]]. The video where Conner101ful performed this voice over of Shadow The Hedgehog can be found here.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA3Q34z5M7s (text=refCountref>> That was the last publically released instance of voice acting done by Conner101ful as of the last edit of this page.\r\n\r\n<<hr2Game Developmenthr2>>\r\n<<hr3Early Dayshr3>>\r\nAs a young [[child]], Conner101ful dreamed of getting into game development. Eventually, much later in his life, Conner101ful would be made to use [[Scratch|Scratch (MIT)]] during one of his classes in school. His first ever game made using Scratch had been a barely functional [[clicker game]] centered around [[Champ99]] and his [[money]] [[factory]]. Champ99 would stick to Conner101ful's brain like glue. Future games would be centered around the character of Champ99 and this would later expand into a full-blown [[animated|animation]] series on scratch that never made it past 2 episodes and 3 parts of a 3rd episode. After the creation of the 2nd episode of the Champ99 series, Conner would make his first playable game. It was titled \"Money Factory Mayhem\". The game was a top-down [[bullet hell|Bullet Hell]] game. In this game, the player would play as the Scratch Cat and would be tasked with dodging a series of simple patterns in order to progress the game. later, development would begin on a much more refined variation of the game that was intended to have 6 bosses. That remake would be partially made, but never completed. Instead, a new game was being developed called \"Champ99 Project 1 ~ The Golden Amulet\". This would see development until the first boss and would never get picked up again. This led into the development of the Scratch version of \"Champ99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet\", which would get no more than basic movement and a simplistic title screen. Currently, all the Scratch Champ99 projects made by Conner101ful are private, but he does still have access to them.\r\n\r\n&p\r\n<<hr3Post Scratchhr3>>\r\nDuring his junior year of [[high school]], Conner101ful would take a Computer Science Essentials class, taught by the person who would later make [[Pickcode]]. The class had started out with block based coding, which Conner101ful was quite familiar with from his experience in Scratch. His teacher was very good at their job, and helped Conner101ful out greatly during times when he wanted to go above and beyond on projects. Later, the class would move beyond the block coding and move into [[Python|Python (Programming Language)]]. Towards the end of the year, the class was tasked with making a final project. Conner101ful had remembered the Champ99 series and decided to bring it back. His project was intended to be a 1 stage [[demo|Game Demo]] of {{iChamp99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet}}. Conner101ful, ever the star shooter, hit the moon instead, only getting as far as a basic movement demo complete with a \"focus mode\", \"power\" mechanics, and two distinct shot types. This project would later receive more development during his senior year of high school as he was taking a Computer Science Principals class. In that class, he learned more about [[Pygame]], which aided in development of this Champ99 game.\r\n\r\n<<hr3Post High Schoolhhr3>>\r\nWhen the seniors of his high school were made to leave and prepare for the graduation ceremony, Conner101ful's development for the 1st installment of the Champ99 Project series would continue in [[Pycharm|Pycharm (IDE)]]. This development was continued until testing for the [[danmaku|Bullet Hell]] system for the game. Conner101ful would get incredibly frustrated with it, as the game's frame rate would drop rapidly and the sprites for the bullets would become horrifically mangled. He would soon make the switch to the [[Godot|Godot (Game Engine)]]. Rebuilding the game from the ground up again went smoothly. As of last page edit, development of {{iChamp99 1 ~ Mystic Amulet}} is on pause. During the Post High School stage of development, the lore for the [[Champ99 series|Champ99 Project (Conner101ful)]] would expand greatly. Conner101ful would also start production of the 4th and final installment of the Champ99 Project series, a book titled {{iChamp99 Project 4: To Hell and Back}}. The 4th installment of the series reuses and remasters the plot of the 3rd installment of the original Champ99 animated series Conner101ful made on Scratch. As of the last page edit, this book is unfinished, but in its final stage of the [[first draft|Drafting (Writing)]].\r\n\r\n<<hr2YouTube Channelhr2>>\r\nThe name \"Conner101ful\" originally stemmed from the original Conner101ful YouTube channel owned by Conner. This channel would be made in 2012 and would consist of mainly [[Minecraft]] and [[Terraria]] content filmed from his [[Nintendo 3DS]] and uploaded to his channel from that very same console. Eventually however, the content would move to being made from his computer. Then the original Conner101ful channel would be deleted due to the creator's own shame of his past. The channel would soon be remade with the same name in early 2021. The channel solely consists of gameplay videos. The videos, as of last page edit, consist of replay file recordings of his gameplay in [[Touhou Project]]. His YouTube channel can be found here.<<ref(content=link|https://www.youtube.com/@conner101ful/videos (text=refCountref>>\r\n\r\n<<hrConner Lorehr>>\r\n<<img(src=https://dl.imgdrop.io/file/aed8b140-8472-4813-922b-7ce35ef93c9e/2024/11/21/45645645646c624ac33ffa6cfe2.webp(cap=Conner101ful as seen in an appearance in a scrapped [[mod|Game Mod]] of [[Friday Night Funkin]].img>>\r\n\r\n{{iConner Lore}} refers to the \"lore\" surrounding the guy who goes by Conner101ful. Conner Lore is mainly an inside joke among close friends. It gets increasingly more absurd with ever increase in the lore. This all started after the \"Great Falling Out\" where Conner left his previous friend group behind after a disagreement involving Conner101ful being seriously romantically attracted to the fictional character of [[Utsuho Reiuji|Utsuho Reiuji (Touhou Project)]]. During this period of Conner101ful's life when Conner101ful was settling himself in a new friend group that the Conner Lore began. At first it began as Conner being a ghost because of his mic in a Discord call sounding like he was a considerable distance away. This spiraled into him being in the [[Backrooms]] and subsequently him transcending reality itself. Conner Lore continues to expand to this day, such as the time he battled his [[.EXE|.EXE (Creepypasta)]] or dabbled in ice cream merchandising.#$$$#2024-11-21#$$$#Conner101ful#$$$#2024-11-21#$$$#"}
