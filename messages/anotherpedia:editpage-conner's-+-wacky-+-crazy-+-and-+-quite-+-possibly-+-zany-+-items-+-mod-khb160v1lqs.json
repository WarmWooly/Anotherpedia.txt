This mod adds new [[items|Item (Minecraft)]], [[structures|Structure (Minecraft)]], new [[dimensions|Dimension (Minecraft)]], and more. This mod is the successor to two prior unfinished mods made by Conner101ful. This mod is currently available for [[1.21.1|Minecraft: Java Edition 1.21.1]] for the [[NeoForge|NeoForge (Minecraft mod loader)]] mod loader.<<ref(content=link|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kG59SPvSBro_ko9fio0_XSo5hcfqCpV1/view?usp=sharing(text=refCountref>> The [[acronym]], {{iCWCAQPZIM}}, is pronounced \"swəkakpzɪm\".<<hrNew Weaponshr>>{{iCWCAQPZIM}} adds a new weapon type from this mod: the scythe. The scythes are meant to be a combination of the [[sword|sword (Minecraft)]] and [[axe|axe (Minecraft)]], blending the axe's raw damage and the sword's sweeping ability. The scythe has the cooldown of an axe as well. A scythe can be made from wood, [[stone|cobblestone (Minecraft)]], [[iron|iron ingot (Minecraft)]], [[diamond|diamond (Minecraft)]], and [[netherite|Netherite (Minecraft)]]. A scythe can be crafted by placing 3 of the material on the top row of the crafting grid, and 2 [[sticks|stick (Minecraft)]] in the center and bottom right slots. For a netherite scythe, you must first craft a diamond scythe and then apply a [[netherite upgrade|netherite upgrade]] with a [[netherite ingot|netherite ingot]] at a [[smithing table|Smithing Table (Minecraft)]].<<hrThe Nendtherhr>><<img(src=https://i.ibb.co/Z6qcqZx/2024-11-27-15-15-18.png(cap=An image depicting the portal to enter the Nendther.img>><<img(src=https://i.ibb.co/ZHS2Zmc/2024-11-27-15-18-36.png(cap=The Nendther.(leftImgimg>><<img(src=https://i.ibb.co/5xRJmsT/2024-11-27-15-22-46.png(cap=One of the structures found in the Nendther.img>>Originating from [[{{iMinecraft: Java Edition}} 20w14∞]], the Nendther is brought back in this mod and given new life. This dimension can be accessed by lighting a portal made out of [[reinforced deepslate|Reinforced Deepslate (Minecraft)]] using a [[nendther gateway key|Nendther Gateway Key (CWCAQPZIM)]]. While it is possible to craft this Nendther Gateway key, it is advised that the player purchase it from the [[Nendther Expert|Nendther Expert (CWCAQPZIM)]] [[villager|villager (Minecraft)]]. In this dimension, [[Endermen|Enderman (Minecraft)]] can spawn. This dimension is very dark, only being lit up by the occasional patches of bizarre plant life. Rarely, a player may stumble upon a structure containing loot that may prove quite valuable.<<hrNew cropshr>>A new crop type is added in {{iCWCAQPZIM}} that can be used to grow various minerals, [[apples|apple (Minecraft)]], and [[blaze rods|blaze rod (Minecraft)]]. Most of these crops are crafted in a smithing table, using a block of that mineral, a specific template, and a base. Apples play a key role in one of the aspects of this mod, so it is advised that players set up a method of farming apples.<<hrMiscellaneous itemshr>>Plenty of other items are added by this mod, some more useful than others. From a block of unreasonably condensed emerald to the key to immortality. Some of the more useful items would include the [[portable storage gap|Portable Storage Gap (CWCAQPZIM)]] and [[grand experience bottle|Grand Experience Bottle (CWCAQPZIM)]]. For players interested in flexing on people, there are plenty of items for that as well, such as the [[one very expensive bookshelf|One Very Expensive Bookshelf (CWCAQPZIM)]], the [[enchanted netherite block|Enchanted Netherite Block (CWCAQPZIM)]], and [[the Apple of Minecraft|The Apple of Minecraft (CWCAQPZIM)]].#$$$#2024-11-27#$$$#Conner101ful#$$$#2024-11-29#$$$#"}
