This mod adds new [[items|Item (Minecraft)]], new [[structures|Structure (Minecraft)]], a new [[dimension|Dimension (Minecraft)]], and more. This mod is the successor to two prior mods made by Conner101ful. {{iConner's Wacky Crazy And Quite Possibly Zany Items Mod}} is a side project of Conner101ful's with on/off development. This mod is for the [[1.20.1|Minecraft: Java Edition 1.20.1]] version of Minecraft and does not need any other mods to function. This mod is developed with [[MCreator]]. Due to the long name of this mod, it is frequently referred to by the [[acronym|Acronym]] of \"CWCAQPZIM\". This is pronounced \"swəkakpzɪm\" in verbal communication. This mod is currently unavailable for public play.\r\n\r\n<<hrNew Weaponshr>>\r\nA new weapon type from this mod is the scythe. This weapon type originated from one of the two mods remastered for this mod. The scythe weapons are meant to be a combination of the sword and axe, blending together the axe's raw damage and the sword's sweeping. The scythe has the cooldown of an axe as well. A scythe can be made from wood, stone, iron, diamond, and [[netherite|Netherite (Minecraft)]]. A scythe can be crafted by placing 3 of the material on the top row of the crafting grid, and 2 sticks in the remaining 2 crafting slots of the column furthest to the right. However for a netherite scythe, you must first craft a diamond scythe and then upgrade it to a netherite scythe at a [[smithing table|Smithing Table (Minecraft)]].\r\n\r\n<<hrThe Nendtherhr>>\r\n<<img(src=https://i.ibb.co/Z6qcqZx/2024-11-27-15-15-18.png(cap=An image depicting the portal to enter the Nendther.img>>\r\n<<img(src=https://i.ibb.co/ZHS2Zmc/2024-11-27-15-18-36.png(cap=The Nendther.img>>\r\n<<img(src=https://i.ibb.co/5xRJmsT/2024-11-27-15-22-46.png(cap=One of the structures found in the Nendther.img>>\r\nOriginating from the Minecraft April Fools 2020 snapshot, the Nendther is brought back in this mod and given new life. This dimension can be accessed by lighting a portal made out of [[Reinforced Deepslate|Reinforced Deepslate (Minecraft)]] using a [[Nendther Gateway Key|Nendther Gateway Key (CWCAQPZIM)]]. While it is possible to craft this Nendther Gateway key, it is advised that the play purchase it from the [[Nendther Expert|Nendther Expert (CWCAQPZIM)]] villager. In this dimension, [[Endermen|Enderman| (Minecraft)]] spawn. This dimension is very dark, only being lit up by the occasional patches of bizarre plant life. Rarely, a player may stumble upon structure containing loot that may prove quite valuable.\r\n\r\n<<hrNew Cropshr>>\r\nThis mod adds in one new crop type that can be used to grow various minerals, apples, and blaze rods. Most of these crops are crafted a smithing table, using a block of that mineral, a specific template, and a base. Apples play a key role in one of the aspects of this mod, so it is advised that players set up a method of farming apples.\r\n\r\n<<hr Miscellaneous Items hr>>\r\nPlenty of more items are added by this mod, some more useful than others. From a block of unreasonably condensed emerald, to the key to immortality. Some of the more useful items would include the [[Portable Storage Gap|Portable Storage Gap (CWCAQPZIM)]] and [[Grand Experience Bottle| Grand Experience Bottle (CWCAQPZIM)]]. But for players interested in flexing on people, there are plenty of items for that as well, such as the [[One Very Expensive Bookshelf|One Very Expensive Bookshelf (CWCAQPZIM)]], [[Enchanted Netherite Block|Enchanted Netherite Block (CWCAQPZIM)]], and [[The Apple of Minecraft|The Apple of Minecraft (CWCAQPZIM)]].#$$$#2024-11-27#$$$#Conner101ful#$$$#2024-11-27#$$$#"}
